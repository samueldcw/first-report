<img src=https://fxdayjob.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/stop-loss-strategy.jpg>
<p> There are many precautions that must be taken in order to prevent injury. Some are less comfortable than others but i feel all are absolutley necassary. Everything form merely pregame an postgame interviews to the in beetween days. Its not just taking care of yourrself its also proper mechanics. This being said its not place to change your mechanics so Ill focus mainly on your rituals</p>
<p> Before any game that you expect to pitch in you have to make sure you throw a good a mount of long toss not only will this help prevent injury but it may also allow yourself tto have a good outing. also make sure you strech out your arms and leg really well and if you can use J-Bands I highly reecomend it. If you feel any unusual pain to this point you may consider shutting it down for the day. Aftter the game it is crucial that yoou run and then obviously ice up your arm. In the days following your outing you ust run everyday.  To prevent injury you should alsoplay catch and longtoss the day after dont throw less than about thirty  throws unless you feel pain. After that go back into yoour daily throwing program. I said i would not talk about mechanics but it is importan than you use your legs and as a good rule of thumb never let your elbow drop below your shoulder otherwise you are putting to much strain on your elbow.But agin dont let me change you.
