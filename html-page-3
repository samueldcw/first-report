Prevention
</h1>
<p>
You prevent injury in the first place by streching  before and after you throw. can also long tos once or twice a week which will so that you are not just throwing a distance of 60 feet. You should always rest your arm and set a limit for how many pitches you can throw in a week (DONT BE GENEROUS). ALWAYS ICE YOUR ARM AFTER YOU PITCH. finaly make sure you use proper mechanics when you pitc.
