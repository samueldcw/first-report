<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> No sport comes without its risks regardless of weather they are a contact sport or not. A prime example of a non contact sport with its risks is baseball. The pitcher in base more often then not expeirences more injury then most other positions, and the two hotspots for a pitcher to get injured is his elbow and shoulder. Here I will mostly just be going over elbow injuries. I will teach you how to try to prevent, how to treat it, and also some basic information about the injury itself.</p>
  <p> When given he task of creating a website I quikly new that I wanted to do this because I myself have had a tangel with elbow injuries. About a year and a half ago during one of my starts I began feeling soarness in my arm, but not just a feeling of fatigue or soarness you get after a long outing, and I also started noticing my velocity was dow and my comand was gone. So after the game I iced my am and everythung but in my next outing  I was feeling the same thing in the first inning which ended up being my last inning. I later discover that a growth plate was prety close too breaking away from my elbow and lodging it in my forearm, or something along those lines. Thanks to the fact that i found out when I did I was able to go through a little more than three months of physical therapy, and get back on the mound as strong as ever. Anyway I hope that this article can shed some light on elbow injuries so YOU dont have to skip a beat in your training. So enjoy...

<h2> Prevention </h2>
<img src=https://fxdayjob.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/stop-loss-strategy.jpg>
<p> There are many precautions that must be taken in order to prevent injury. Some are less comfortable than others but i feel all are absolutley necassary. Everything form merely pregame an postgame interviews to the in beetween days. Its not just taking care of yourrself its also proper mechanics. This being said its not place to change your mechanics so Ill focus mainly on your rituals</p>
<p> Before any game that you expect to pitch in you have to make sure you throw a good a mount of long toss not only will this help prevent injury but it may also allow yourself tto have a good outing. also make sure you strech out your arms and leg really well and if you can use J-Bands I highly reecomend it. If you feel any unusual pain to this point you may consider shutting it down for the day. Aftter the game it is crucial that yoou run and then obviously ice up your arm. In the days following your outing you ust run everyday.  To prevent injury you should alsoplay catch and longtoss the day after dont throw less than about thirty  throws unless you feel pain. After that go back into yoour daily throwing program. I said i would not talk about mechanics but it is importan than you use your legs and as a good rule of thumb never let your elbow drop below your shoulder otherwise you are putting to much strain on your elbow.But agin dont let me change you.
