<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> No sport comes without its risks regardless of weather they are a contact sport or not. A prime example of a non contact sport with its risks is baseball. The pitcher in base more often then not expeirences more injury then most other positions, and the two hotspots for a pitcher to get injured is his elbow and shoulder. Here I will mostly just be going over elbow injuries. I will teach you how to try to prevent, how to treat it, and also some basic information about the injury itself.</p>
  <p> When given he task of creating a website I quikly new that I wanted to do this because I myself have had a tangel with elbow injuries. About a year and a half ago during one of my starts I began feeling soarness in my arm, but not just a feeling of fatigue or soarness you get after a long outing, and I also started noticing my velocity was dow and my comand was gone. So after the game I iced my am and everythung but in my next outing  I was feeling the same thing in the first inning which ended up being my last inning. I later discover that a growth plate was prety close too breaking away from my elbow and lodging it in my forearm, or something along those lines. Thanks to the fact that i found out when I did I was able to go through a little more than three months of physical therapy, and get back on the mound as strong as ever. Anyway I hope that this article can shed some light on elbow injuries so YOU dont have to skip a beat in your training. So enjoy...
